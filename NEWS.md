# News file for the blapsr package #

### Version 0.5.1 ###

* **2020-07-13:** The package is available on CRAN for the first time with 
  intial version  0.5.1.

### Changes in version 0.5.5 ###

* Some routines produced an error when only one smooth term was specified. This
  has been corrected, so that fitting a model with only one smooth term is now 
  possible.
  
* The routines allow to fit models for which the dimension of the latent vector
  is larger than the number of observations. A warning is produced whenever this
  is the case.
  
* Citation information for this package has been updated.
