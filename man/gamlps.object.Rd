\title{Object resulting from the fit of a generalized additive model.}
\value{
A \code{gamlps} object has the following elements:

\item{formula}{The formula of the generalized additive model.}
\item{family}{The chosen exponential family.}
\item{link}{The link function used for the fit.}
\item{n}{Sample size.}
\item{q}{Total number of smooth terms.}
\item{K}{Number of B-spline basis functions used for the fit.}
\item{penalty.order}{Chosen penalty order.}
\item{latfield.dim}{The dimension of the latent field. This is equal
 to the sum of the number of B-spline coefficients and the number of
 regression parameters related to the covariates in the linear part.}
\item{linear.coeff}{Estimated linear regression coefficients. This is a
 matrix containing the posterior point estimate, standard deviation, z-score
 and lower/upper bounds of the credible interval.}
\item{spline.estim}{The estimated B-spline coefficients. This is a list
 with \code{q} vectors of size \code{K-1} representing the estimated B-spline
 amplitudes for each smooth term.}
\item{edf}{Estimated effective degrees of freedom for each latent field
 variable.}
\item{Approx.signif}{A matrix returning the observed test statistic and
 p-value for the approximate significance of smooth terms.}
\item{EDf}{The estimated effective degrees of freedom of the smooth terms.}
\item{EDfHPD.95}{95\% HPD interval for the degrees of freedom of the smooth
 terms.}
\item{ED}{The estimated degrees of freedom of the GAM model.}
\item{vmap}{The maximum a posteriori of the (log) posterior penalty vector.}
\item{Cov.vmap}{Covariance matrix of the (log) posterior penalty vector
 evaluated at vmap.}
\item{pen.family}{The family of the posterior distribution for v. It is
 either "skew-normal" or "gaussian".}
\item{pendist.params}{The parameterization for the posterior distribution of
 v. If the posterior of v belongs to the skew-normal family, then
 \code{pendist.params} is a matrix with as many rows as the number of smooth
 terms \code{q}. Each row contains the location, scale and shape parameter
 of the skew-normal distribution. If the posterior of v belongs to the
 Gaussian family, then \code{pendist.params} is a vector of length \code{q},
 corresponding to \code{vmap}.}
\item{Covmaximum}{The covariance matrix of the latent field evaluated at the
 posterior maximum value of the penalty vector.}
\item{latmaximum}{The latent field value evaluated at the posterior
 maximum value of the penalty vector.}
\item{fitted.values}{The fitted response values.}
\item{residuals}{The response residuals.}
\item{r2.adj}{The adjusted r-squared of the model indicating the proportion
 of the data variance explained by the model fit.}
\item{data}{The data frame of the model.}
