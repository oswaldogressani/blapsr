### Purpose ###
<hr />

The blapsr package consists in a set of routines that can be used for analysis
in survival models and (generalized) additive models. The methodology is based 
on the combination of Bayesian P-splines for flexible estimation of smooth 
functions and Laplace approximations to (selected) posterior distributions.

### Website ###
<hr />

A website is dedicated to the package: www.blapsr-project.org

### Special thanks ###
<hr />

This package was developed during a PhD thesis at Université catholique de Louvain (Belgium) that was funded in part by the Actions de Recherche Concertées
(ARC 11/16-039) grant and another grant obtained from the Luxembourgish Ministry 
of higher education.

We are grateful to Vincent Bremhorst for providing the function on which the 
simcuredata.R routine is based. The latter is used for generating survival times
in the promotion time cure model (Bremhorst and Lambert, 2016).
