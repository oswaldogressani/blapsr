Purpose
=======

The blapsr package consists in a set of routines that can be used for
analysis in survival models and (generalized) additive models. The
methodology is based on the combination of Bayesian P-splines for
flexible estimation of smooth functions and Laplace approximations to
(selected) posterior distributions.

Website
=======

A website is dedicated to the package: www.blapsr-project.org

Special thanks
==============

This package was developed during a PhD thesis at Université catholique
de Louvain (Belgium) that was funded in part by the Actions de Recherche
Concertées (ARC 11/16-039) grant and another grant obtained from the
Luxembourgish Ministry of higher education.

We are grateful to Vincent Bremhorst for providing the function on which
the simcuredata.R routine is based. The latter is used for generating
survival times in the promotion time cure model (Bremhorst and Lambert,
2016).
